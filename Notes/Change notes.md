I don't toggle test anymore and also I only ever use the second version, and also the first one is renamed anyway

I'll instead build a gui for the input and have three buttons that you can click to set what it does. 

The docs boutta become smaller and the code bigger

Thinking that I'll probably need to use a class for the variable since it's a boundfunc and likely won't change the higher local variable

Kinda annoying how besides the code I also have to redo the comments

Oh yeah, far easier to look around and work on the function if it's not cluttered with comments. I can only say that as the developer who programmed it though, otherwise comments ftw. So, in development I can duplicate the function, renaming it, and delete the comments so it's easier to work on. Then I can grab the comments from the untouched initial function and put those that are correct into the new one. Rewrite those that aren't. Boom. Realistically, this is probably the idea you first think is great and then come to relize what it entails. Well, I don't got any tails rn so it will be my way to go.
