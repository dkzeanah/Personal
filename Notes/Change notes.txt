Remember NOT to get the image when it's highlighted, worst mistake of my life

xbutton1 & lbutton becomes select all on hold

no space on mouse

sp & mb reloads vs code as well

alt ` is no longer media play pause since I don't use it
it is "close side bar and focus editor" instead

Thanks to @rbstrachan I can now switch my keyboard layout to a *specific* language, and also in a much better way than just sending windows + space
So, the [f[ff[ thing now uses that, and so does the fullscreen hotkey for youtube, since it requires you to use the english layout to work
