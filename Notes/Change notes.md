Todoist winreactivate doesn't have to be as complicated as it was, winwait functions exist

# FileSearch:

## you pass what you want to do with the file as the first parameter
* copy
* run
* folder

## second parameter is for regex search, usually going to be left off

## Error messages
if you put in wrong parameters for the first or the third parameter. This is so instead of unexpected behaivor or error messages, a more friendly msgbox appears, that explains what needs to be changed

# FileSearchBox:

a way to write the first parameter of the filesearch and your search at the same time. more than likely you're not only gonna use one option, so you can use filesearchbox to type the first parameter of filesearch + space + your search and skip the inputbox of the filesearch that way
