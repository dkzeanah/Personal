Links are now in the links library

Idea from the previous commit â€” implementation

by default, everything that you type into the runner tries to be opened as a property at the very least
p for paste
you *can* specify o for open (being explicit)

if it's something predefined in the main switch, it will get caught, if it doesn't, goes for the second check in the default inner switch, if still doesn't get caught, nothing happens (as it should)

When in vscode, appskey gets its own hotkeys
short tap delete: close tab
long hold delete: close all tabs except the pinned ones
insert: restore tab
pgup: prev tab
pgdn: next tab
home: delete line
end: comment

Appskey for chrome as well, the only differences being 
home: new tab
end: copy link

You can make it play the vine boom sound effect when you catch an error lmao

SoundPlay switched to soundbeep, they are different depending on commands
