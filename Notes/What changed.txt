Now ctrl space ctrl shift space is down and up for all quick open windows
(apparently they are called quick open)

Since I hid .git, you gotta leave the .vscode open for correct coords
(idea to rename lib to 1. Lib so that won't be an issue)

Printscreen is now fully a "launch this" key. Start debugging, Run in terminal and close either the terminal or debug, depending on what's there

The printscreen key is actually connected to sending keys+H

All the debug hotkeys are deleted, aside form debug and stop. It's so I can come up with new ones in the future when I can make them make sense

Idea to separate pure remaps to a different script entirely in the future
