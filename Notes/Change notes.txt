Despite the fact that I can define the default directory of includes, using the "%A_ScriptDir%\..\%.... for every one looks better, and imo more readable

This code picks a random number that isn't a part of the array
Was written by @Micha-ohne-el, thank you very much!!
Loop {
   newNum := Random(0, 9)
   for value in R_PlayedPlaylists {
      if value == newNum 
         continue 2
   }
   break
}

I was able to think of a better way to do what I wanted to achieve with this ^ though, more readable and less wordy as well. 

Playlist picker
;————————————————————————————————

Idea: a random playlist picker for youtube music that doesn't pick duplicates. meaning, after listening to the 6th playlist, you'll have to listen to the other nine until you get to the sixth again. 
Now the question is: why not just make a function that remembers what playlist you're on in order? That's a great question. Anyway

Implementation: every time the function picks a new playlist, it stores it in a text file and checks it for the history of the last 10 playlists picked. if the text file has all 10 digits (10 playlists gone through), it starts over
the new picked playlist is guaranteed to not be a duplicate of the last ten, unless it's a new set of shuffle
Shows the new playlist to pick in a gui


Figured out why Volume_Down was being blocked if there are hooked (inputleveled) hotkeys in a separate running script.
apparently, &'ed keys start catching remaps into them, making them do nothing (since &'ed keys stop working)
solution? don't use &'ed keys you could potentially need to send, easy clap


..Libraries => _Libraries 
libs divided into functions and variables
because the former you can load into intellisense, 
the latter you can't, since it's not in the same file

The folder for files that are used as permanent memory is called Innit coming from ini because it's funny
