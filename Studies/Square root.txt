Take a four digits number
12 34

the last two digits might either be 2 or 8

for the first two digits, pick something that's closest to it without being bigger than it
so 3

then pick the the closer number

5 will always be the middle man, so you can calculate if *5 squared is bigger or smaller than your actual number and pick the correct one

to easily calculate squares of doubledigit 5
take the * from *5, multiply it by the number one digit higher than it
and add 25

45 => 4*5 . 25 => 2025


for bigger numbers, like 5 digits, same thing: take the number that's closer without being over it


Cube root

39 304
cross out the last three digits now
and since the cubes of the main 10 numbers are all different digits, no need for the 5 trick
