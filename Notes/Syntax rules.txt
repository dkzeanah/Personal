This files explains my personal syntax and naming conventions

Omit brackets if you can, unless it's your own function

ahk_exe is preferred when possible

OTB everywhere except after more than one hotkey for one function

Fat arrow for functions that are mostly used in nesting or are unwanted in intellisense

ternary for if else
   if for single
      switch for three or more
   
All hotkeys use $

$~*<#^+!

Camel case for variables

Pascal case for everything else

_ after variable for its variations

~ for snippets

R_ for arrays

D_ for dictionaries

F_ for functions

V_ for conflicting variables (usually params)

O_ for objects

C_ for class
(the class' object is _ less)

abbreviation of the class name + _ for class methods 
not for properties since they are vars, not func and won't appear in intellisense anyway

G_ for guis

Gb_gui_ for guis' buttons
