window manipulating methods should be in Win

postmessages that are things like winclose, winminimize and the like should be used instead of ahk's commands
better to talk to a french person in french rather than with a really good translator

if there's a question about what's faster, it can be argued either way, but almost all of my code is inside of a function or method, so speed isn't necessarily the most important thing here
for this case it's a matter of consistency and reliability: I've had issues with winminimize but didn't with the postmessage for it
maybe that's the only example where it's not a logical fallacy, but let me sniff copium here
if I'll need to, I'll realize


A function that closes a window after a period after it became unactive
usage: you open a folder with memes, drag one into your messenger and don't have to worry about closing the window after

Turns out that explorer windows might not be able to / can't have PID's (unlike your mom)

"sound" opens the sounds folder for you to drag them in some messenger (or not), autocloses after 5 secs of inactivity

"sound 'soundname'" plays the soundname

after launching mousegetpos, you can press F4 to get the color of the pixel under your cursor
formatting option for controlclick only
F2 — client
F3 — screen
F4 — window
F5 — pixel


WaitUntilImage: keeps searching for the specified image until it finds it, returns an array with the x and y coords

WaitClick: controlclicks those coords when waituntilimage finds them


switch youtube / youtube music account is now a single press thanks to that!

add to playlist script is now also a single click to add to a playlist, leaves you to actually leave the selection screen though

I should really make commits more often
