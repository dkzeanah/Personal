FileSearch. Probably the coolest thing I've ever done yet.

So basically it's windows' file search but actually usable

You pick the folder you want to search

What search entry you want to search for

And then you get a list of all the files that matched.

When you double click on one of them, you copy the full path of it to your clipboard and open the folder where it's located. 

Doesn't highlight it though, idk how to do that. Probably some dllcall or smth

You can disable it opening by setting the first parameter to false
