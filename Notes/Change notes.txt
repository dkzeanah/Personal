I only use two options from the screenshotter, so the scrollwheel will only go between those two

ytm link converter moved to +!v for less conflictions

^BackSpace works in inputboxes, but deletes all instead
(deleteall now a base method)

One piece downloader is now a runner-able separate script

Snippet now simply have the snippet prefix, unless they make sense as parts of normal programming (stuff like function, class, big and small separator, imports (since they are just variations of the include))
Essentially, random needed parts of code are just "snippet"

For when no other cases match, it goes to the default, trying to regex match stuff that is not set up to be something specific (r 345345 vs ahk yt arrow)

Idea: all the usual stuff that is directly binded stays what it is in the upper switch, but all the links and r 354534 type stuff goes into the lower switch. That is how we go out of the direct switch and then start using cases as evalutions of expressions

the lower switch checks for 'flags', using the value after it

d flag for dollar to ruble
r flag for ruble to dollar
o flag for open link 
p flag for paste link
gitlink flag for paste also, in the same regex

The links are going to be properties in the new link class
The value after the flag gets converted to lowercase with _ instead of spaces
And then it tries to p/o the link that is now accessible from the property

The properties are separated into sections, but naturally they don't matter and the naming is the same for all of them
No asdf_ grouping because the chance for them to coincide is too small and I know what I want to paste already


The runner class will since now also include all the small random scripts 
when Runlink, clipsend, clickthengoback and the like are so useful that might as well be included everywhere, nur_Emoji definitely isn't and makes sense to have in a class instead


Clipsend now uses ClipBoardAll() and the reversion check is direct rather than to a function for speed purposes. No need to flush the var since it's a function

.tag bad to paste both ahkformatted and rule5
Not written with clipsend because while you're pasting the first tag, your clipboard has already changed to the second one, so you end up pasting the second one twice
Removed, actually, for the same reason markdown isn't in hotkeys

XButton1 & MButton is delete message

Shift esc and win alt delete now closes all files except the pinned ones
