For whatever reason, a separate script with remaps / a separate script with inputlevel remaps (any int) turns off remaps of volume_down, possibly all the other remaps overall

Because of that, the doubles for the numpad will instead be in one section
Things that I will actually use, so not all of them
Since they are remaps still, innate hotkeys will work already
